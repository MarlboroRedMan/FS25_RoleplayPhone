## Installation

1. Download `FS25_RoleplayInvoices.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Place the zip file directly into your FS25 mods folder:
   - **Windows:** `Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\mods\`
3. Enable the mod in the FS25 mod manager before loading your save
4. **Do not unzip** — FS25 reads mods directly from the zip file

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not use the "Download ZIP" button from the main GitHub page — that version wraps the files in a subfolder and will not work. Always download from the Releases page.

## Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| F7 | Open / Close phone |
| F8 | Answer or hang up call (works on foot and in vehicles) |

Both bindings are remappable in the FS25 key bindings menu.

## How to Use

### Opening the Phone
Press **F7** to toggle the phone open and closed while on foot. The phone cannot be opened while in a vehicle — but if a call comes in while driving, press **F8** to answer or hang up without needing to open the phone.

### Sending an Invoice
1. Open the phone and tap **Invoices**
2. Tap **+ New Invoice**
3. Select the recipient farm, category, amount, and add a description and notes
4. Tap **Send** — the recipient will see it in their Inbox

### Paying an Invoice
1. Open your **Inbox**
2. Select the invoice
3. Tap **Pay** — the amount is deducted from your farm account and the invoice is marked PAID

### Calling a Contact
1. Open the phone and tap **Contacts**
2. Tap a contact to open their detail screen
3. Tap **Call** — a compact call popup appears (you can still drive)
4. The other player presses **F8** to answer — or **F8** again to hang up

### Messaging
1. Open the phone and tap **Contacts**
2. Tap a contact → tap **Message**
3. Type your message and tap **Send**

### A Note on Phone Numbers
The phone number field is cosmetic RP flavor only — it doesn't route calls or do anything functional. Players can enter any format they like, up to 60 characters. All of these work fine:
- `555-0101`
- `(555)555-1000`
- `6546494564`
- Any custom format your server agrees on

## Multiplayer Notes

- The **host** handles all invoice saving and loading
- Clients receive invoice and contact updates in real time via network sync
- Clients do not need direct access to the savegame directory
- All invoice actions (pay, reject, mark paid) broadcast to all connected players
- Incoming calls do not freeze either player — the call popup is non-blocking
- **New save recommended** — starting a fresh save avoids any leftover data from older versions of the mod
- **Contacts are per-farm** — each player manages their own contact list, contacts do not sync between players
- **The zip filename matters** — the file must stay named `FS25_RoleplayPhone.zip`, do not rename it

## Current Version

**v0.2.0** — Major update adding calls, messaging, notifications, recent calls, contact overhaul, and multiplayer fixes
